## This is a code snippet for powershell to create email functionality that contains a way to add credentials in a secure manner
## to an automated script.

First step is to create the encrypted file with the following 2 lines on the machine that you want to create the encrypted file on.

##    "YourPassword"|ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -force|ConvertFrom-SecureString| out-file "C:\SCRIPTS\securestring.txt"

##This will create the file in the out-file location, with the password encrypted.

##Then in the script that you want to use the password in, reference the location\file for the credentials as shown below.


$pass=get-content C:\scripts\securestring.txt |ConvertTo-SecureString
$username="dba@blahblahblah.net"
$mycred=new-object -typename System.Management.Automation.pscredential -argumentlist $username,$pass

send-mailmessage -from "Data Services <dba@blahblahblah.net>" -to $recipients -subject "Email Subject" `
-body "This is where you place the body of the email" `
-SmtpServer smtp.address.com -Credential $mycred -UseSsl -Port 587
